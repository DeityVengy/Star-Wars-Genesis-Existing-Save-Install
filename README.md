# Star Wars Genesis - Existing Save Install

- If a pop-up asking about load order appears, make sure you click CURRENT
- If a warning pops up saying x plugin is missing, do NOT search for it in the creations menu and CONTINUE loading without it. These are redundant plugins that have been integrated into Star Wars Genesis
- If you see a popup as soon as you load in about SKK Fast Start and a STOP CODE. Just close it and don't worry about it.
- Check how much HP your character has under the _Status_ menu. If you're level 1, you should have 100 HP. If you're level 50, you should have around 150 hp, etc. If you're missing HP (for example someone went from v3 to v4 and only had 13 hp), then you must cheat your health back to normal with this command:<br />
   1. _player.modav health x_ <br />
   2. X being the number of health you want to add to your character. If you have 13 hp and are level 50, then you do _player.modav health 137_ to reach 150 intended health.
- Check your inventory and make sure there aren't any invisible armors. If there are, then drop them on the ground and disable them. 
- Teleport to major locationm such as Coruscant, Dantooine, and Nar Shaddaa and check if you crash. If you crash you're fucked.
- If any NPC's are unchanged or buggy, then open console, click them, disable, close console, and enable.
- Ask yourself if you really want to go through with all this and dozens of other issues included in installing this on an existing save
